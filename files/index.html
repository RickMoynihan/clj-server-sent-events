  <h1>Server sent events example</h1>
  <p>Run the server, by evaluating the sse.core namespace and visit
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>,
    you've probably already done this if you're viewing this page.</p>
  
  <p>Next, in your clojure REPL run the following command: </p>

    <pre>(sse.core "Hello World!")/</pre>
    
  <p>This should result in a javascript alert box displaying the
  event.</p>
